# README for DAGs Test Sync Project

## Project Overview
This project contains a test Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) for Apache Airflow, designed to run using the Kubernetes executor with a standard Python image. The DAG is defined in the `dags/dag_test.py` file and includes a simple workflow that demonstrates the capabilities of Airflow in a Kubernetes environment.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**
   Clone this repository to your local machine using:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   Navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Kubernetes Configuration**
   Ensure that your Kubernetes cluster is set up and that you have the necessary permissions to deploy Airflow. You may need to configure your `kubectl` context to point to the correct cluster.

4. **Deploy Airflow**
   Follow the official Apache Airflow documentation to deploy Airflow on your Kubernetes cluster. Make sure to configure the executor to use the Kubernetes executor.

5. **Run the DAG**
   Once Airflow is up and running, you can access the Airflow web interface. The test DAG defined in `dags/dag_test.py` should be visible. You can trigger the DAG manually or set it to run on a schedule.

## Additional Information
- Ensure that the standard Python image is available in your Kubernetes environment.
- Modify the DAG as needed to fit your specific use case or to add additional tasks.
